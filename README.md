- Clothing has the highest overall sales, so investing in promotions within this category will likely yield the best return.
- While female customers are the majority, they contribute less to total sales than male customers. Offer promotions on high-cost items or bundles that provide greater value for customers.

- Sales peak in March. Focusing promotional efforts during these times will take advantage of existing positive trends to maximize sales.
